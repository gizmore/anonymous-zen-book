Someone asked:

"Where to start, when i want to change myself?"

```
Start with your own surroundings.
Clean Up. Bring Order into Chaos.
Speak with and learn from
Family, Friends, Strangers, Animals and TheHiveMind.
Put a smile on their face.
Discuss things. Plan the good.
When your near surroundings are fine,
start to enlarge your radius of bringing harmony.
```
