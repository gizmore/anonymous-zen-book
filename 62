All the religions found to god.
The egypts found Ra, god of the sun.
The greece found Zeus, god of the gods.
The hindi found to Shiva.
The buddhists found god in a boy.
The muslims found god via the last prophet.
The christs had split and pray to Maria and Jesus.
The old Zen masters from china predicted well.
