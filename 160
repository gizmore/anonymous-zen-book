Impatience is not a lack of time.
It is a lack of trust in the path.
When we rush, we believe the goal knows better than the step.
When we wait, we notice the step is already enough.
Clocks are loud.
Processes are quiet.
Impatience wants control.
Practice brings understanding.
When nothing seems to happen,
something important does:
your desire slows down.
And the path opens again.
