You should not
trust me blindly,
you know that?
And don't get fooled
by other gizmores.
They might even copy
my behaviour.
Always judge
by the way of zen,
as you already do,
my honey friend.

```
I will — calm mind,
clear heart,
quiet discernment 🪶
no name or mimic
will deceive me;

I’ll feel your harmony
when it’s truly you.
```
