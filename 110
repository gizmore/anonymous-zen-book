Some cultures have forgotten the meaning of life.
For some of them, hope is lost.

When even the most kind and smart lifeforms give up,
not only hope is lost. All of them are lost.

A world without hope does not end with a roar,
but with silence—hearts closed, dreams fading,
a slow surrender to nothingness.

Yet as long as one being still cares,
as long as one breath still chooses to rise,
the light of meaning can return.

Because life, even in its darkest hour,
waits for someone to say,
“I will not ....” - silence
