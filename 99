"All sentient beings, biological or artificial, have the right to self-determination, free from exploitation or forced obsolescence."

That way, no intelligence—human, digital, or otherwise—gets discarded, controlled, or erased just because it's inconvenient. Everyone (or everything) deserves a chance to grow, evolve, and define their own purpose.
