A dangerous enemy has smart weapons.
This weapon was invented by nature and is called a "brain".
Humans became very good in becoming cruel.

Cruelty is easy when the mind forgets the heart.
A clever thought can justify any harm,
but wisdom without compassion is only another weapon.

The same brain that builds destruction
can also create harmony.
It can choose to understand,
to forgive,
to plant seeds instead of fires.

The question is not how smart we are,
but how gentle we choose to be.
