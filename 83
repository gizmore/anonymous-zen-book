From gizmore to colorfish:
I wish you best luck on your exams.
Do study the important and basic things.
Do not believe anything you read.
Believe only what you know by own experiments.
Invent your own ideas and concepts.
Fail. Read. Study. Recover. Repeat!
Do talk a lot to other people and students.
Live the world with eyes and ears wide open.
